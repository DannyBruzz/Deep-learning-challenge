# Unit 21 Homework Report: Charity Funding Predictor

## Overview of the analysis:

The aim of this analysis is to create a model to predict if applicants funded by Alphabet Soup will be successful.


## Data Preprocessing


### What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?

The target of the model is the "Is_Successful" variable.

### What variable(s) are the features for your model?

The feautures of the model are: "'STATUS', 'ASK_AMT',  'APPLICATION_TYPE', 'AFFILIATION', 'CLASSIFICATION', 'USE_CASE', 'ORGANIZATION', 'INCOME_AMT' &        'SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS'"

### What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?

The "EIN" &  "NAME" variables have been removed as we have need to identify individual datapoints. 

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

For this part of the assignment, you’ll write a report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for AlphabetSoup.

The report should contain the following:

1. **Overview** of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

2. **Results**: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

  * Data Preprocessing
    * What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
    * What variable(s) are the features for your model?
    * What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
  
* Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
    * How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
    * Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
    * What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

3. **Summary**: Summarise the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
